    <h2>The history of Brain</h2>
    
    
    <div class="abstract">
    <p>To understand modern neuroscience not only you should know some biology, physiology, psychology, evolution etc., but should know some of the history behind this field. In this essay I try to have a brief survey in the history of the brain by using different sources.</p></div>
    
    
    <p> The curiosity of the function of the brain and mind has been among the people from many years ago. The <b>Edwin Smith</b> Surgical Papyrus, written in the 17th century BC, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain. The manuscript had pointed to brain for eight times and described the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two patients who had wounds and fractures on their head. The assessments of the author (a battlefield surgeon) of the papyrus allude to ancient Egyptians having a vague recognition of the effects of head trauma.</p>

<p>During the second half of the first millennium BC, the Ancient Greeks developed differing views on the function of the brain. However, due to the fact that Hippocratic doctors did not practice dissection, because the human body was considered sacred, Greek views of brain function were generally uninformed by anatomical study. It is said that it was the <b>Alcmaeon</b> of Croton (5th century BC) who first considered the brain to be the place where the mind was located. In the 4th century BC, <b>Hippocrates</b> believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence. During the 4th century BC <b>Aristotle</b> thought that, while the heart was the seat of intelligence, the brain was a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness.

<p>During the Hellenistic period, <b>Herophilus</b> of Chalcedon (300 BC) and <b>Erasistratus</b> of Ceos (240 BC) made fundamental contributions not only to brain and nervous systems' anatomy and physiology, but to many other fields of the bio-sciences. <b>Herophilus</b> not only distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, but provided the first clear description of the ventricles.

<p> The Greek anatomist <b>Aelius Galenus</b> (160 AD) dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, swine, among other non-human mammals. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles. His studies of the cranial nerves and spinal cord were outstanding. He noted that specific spinal nerves controlled specific muscles, and had the idea of the reciprocal action of muscles. A higher understanding of the spinal function became possible by <b>Bell</b> and <b>Magendie</b> in the 19th Century.

<p>In the middle age, <b>Ibn-sina</b> (980 AC) presented detailed knowledge about skull fractures and their surgical treatments. He also explained phenomena such as, insomnia, mania, hallucinations, nightmare, dementia, epilepsy, stroke, paralysis, vertigo, melancholia and tremors. Avicenna is regarded by some as the father of modern medicine. He wrote 40 pieces on medicine with the most notable being the <b>Qanun, a medical encyclopedia</b> that would become a staple at universities for nearly a hundred years. Between the 13th and 14th centuries, the <b>first anatomy textbooks in Europe</b>, which included a description of the brain, were written by <b>Mondino de Luzzi</b> and <b>Guido da Vigevano</b></p>

<p>In the Renaissance, <b>Andreas Vesalius</b> (16th cen) found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy. Vesalius noted many structural characteristics of both the brain and general nervous system during his dissections. In addition to recording many anatomical features such as the putamen and corpus callosum. <b>René Descartes</b> (15-16 cen) also studied the physiology of the brain, proposing the theory of <b>dualism</b> to tackle the issue of the brain's relation to the mind. He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid.

<p><b>Jan Swammerdam</b> (17th cen) placed severed frog thigh muscle in an airtight syringe with a small amount of water in the tip and when he caused the muscle to contract by irritating the nerve, the water level did not rise but rather was lowered by a minute amount debunking balloonist theory. The idea that <b>nerve stimulation led to movement</b> had important implications by putting forward the idea that behavior is based on stimuli. In 1658, he was the first to observe and describe <b>red blood cells</b>. He was one of the first people to use the microscope in dissections, and his techniques remained useful for hundreds of years. <b>Thomas Willis</b> studied the brain, nerves, and behavior to develop neurologic treatments. He described in great detail the structure of the brainstem, the cerebellum, the ventricles, and the cerebral hemispheres.</p>

<p>The role of electricity in nerves was first observed in dissected frogs by <b>Luigi Galvani</b>, <b>Lucia Galeazzi Galvani</b> and <b>Giovanni Aldini</b> in the second half of the 18th century. In 1811, <b>César Julien Jean Legallois</b> defined a specific function of a brain region for the first time. He studied respiration in animal dissection and lesions, and found the center of respiration in the <b>medulla oblongata</b>.

<p>Between 1811 and 1824, <b>Charles Bell</b> and <b>François Magendie</b> discovered through dissection and vivisection that the ventral roots in spine transmit motor impulses and the dorsal roots receive sensory input (Bell-Magendie law). In the 1820s, <b>Jean Pierre Flourens</b>, the founder of experimental brain science, pioneered the experimental method of carrying out localized lesions of the brain in animals describing their effects on motricity, sensibility and behavior. At mid-century, <b>Emil du Bois-Reymond</b>, <b>Johannes Peter Müller</b>, and <b>Hermann von Helmholtz</b> showed neurons were electrically excitable and that their activity predictably affected the electrical state of adjacent neurons. In 1848, <b>John Martyn Harlow</b> described that Phineas Gage (a brain-injury survivor) had his frontal lobe pierced by an iron tamping rod in a blasting accident. He became a case study in the connection between the prefrontal cortex and executive functions. <b>Richard Caton</b> presented his findings in 1875 about electrical phenomena of the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys, he laid the groundwork for <b>Hans Berger</b> to discover alpha wave activity in the human brain. In 1878, <b>Hermann Munk</b> found in dogs and monkeys that vision was localized in the occipital cortical area, <b>David Ferrier</b> found in 1881 that audition was localized in the superior temporal gyrus and in 1909 <b>Harvey Cushing</b> found that the sense of touch was localized in the postcentral gyrus.

  <figcaption>Hermann von Helmholtz: He was a pioneer in the scientific study of human vision and audition. In 1851, Helmholtz revolutionized the field of ophthalmology with the invention of the ophthalmoscope (right). In 1849, while at Königsberg, Helmholtz measured the speed at which the signal is carried along a nerve fibre. At that time most people believed that nerve signals passed along nerves immeasurably fast. In 1871, Helmholtz moved from Heidelberg to Berlin to become a professor in physics. He became interested in electromagnetism, and the Helmholtz equation is named for him. Helmholtz had stressed the importance of materialism, and was focusing more on the unity of "mind" and body.</figcaption>

<p>Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the <b>invention of the microscope</b> and the development of a staining procedure by <b>Camillo Golgi</b> during the late 1890s that used a silver chromate salt to reveal the intricate structures of single neurons. His technique was used by <b>Santiago Ramón y Cajal</b> and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine, the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron. Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the <b>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</b> in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain. The hypotheses of the neuron doctrine were supported by experiments following Galvani's pioneering work in the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons.

  <figcaption>Camillo Golgi: His discovery of a staining technique called black reaction in 1873 was a major breakthrough in neuroscience. He drew up a new classification of cells on the basis of the structure of their nervous prolongation. olgi presented the reticular theory which states that the brain is a single network of nerve fibres, and not of discrete cells, although his works clearly depicted the axonal connections as independent of one another. Golgi's theory was challenged by Ramón y Cajal. In addition to this, Golgi was the first to give clear descriptions of the structure of the cerebellum, hippocampus, spinal cord, olfactory lobe, as well as striatal and cortical lesions in a case of chorea. He further developed a stain specific for myelin (a specialised portion of axon).</figcaption>
  <figcaption>Glogi also could prove that malarial parasite is a microscopic protozoan. He established two types of malaria, tertian and quartan fevers. An organelle in eukaryotice cells now known as Golgi apparatus or Golgi complex is another discovery by Camillo Golgi. However, at first his description was largely rejected and it established 50 years later.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>Hundreds of his drawings illustrating the arborizations of brain cells are still in use since the mid-20th century, for educational and training purposes. He experimentally demonstrated that the relationship between nerve cells is not continuous and he stood against reticular theory. This provided definitive evidence for "neuron theory". By producing excellent depictions of neural structures and their connectivity, he discovered a new type of cell (interstitial cell of Cajal). Cajal also had prominent contribution in social activities.</figcaption>

<p>Towards the end of the nineteenth century <b>Francis Gotch</b> conducted several experiments on nervous system function. In 1899 he described the "inexcitable" or "refractory phase" that takes place between nerve impulses. His primary focus was on how nerve interaction affected the muscles and eyes. <b>Heinrich Obersteiner</b> in 1887 founded the ‘‘Institute for Anatomy and Physiology of the CNS’’, later called Neurological or Obersteiner Institute of the Vienna University School of Medicine. It was one of the <b>first brain research institutions</b> in the world. The eponymous Obersteiner–Redlich line is named after him, along with <b>Emil Redlich</b> (1866–1930).
